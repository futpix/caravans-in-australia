### What is the Erasmus Program? {#what-is-the-erasmus-programme-d}

So you’ve completed reading the checklist, and you’ve passed all the 10 rules of Erasmus. Now you’re set to move to the next step. But first, what on earth is this Erasmus thing anyway? You need to fully understand before applying.


#### Simple explanation {#simple-explanation}

The Erasmus Program is a **European Union initiative that provides students and staff mobility or study abroad opportunities accross partner universities throughout Europe for EU students.**

Erasmus students are those that take advantage of the Erasmus exchange program, a well supported and organised scheme that has been in operation _since the late 1980's_. It allows for students to study at universities in the EU member states for set periods of time.

Erasmus students **study a wide variety of subjects** but most use the program for advancing their language skills with a view to working in the international sphere, and it is advised that anyone interested seeks information on the Erasmus scheme online.

The European Credit Transfer System means that academic credits you earn in your course while abroad _will count towards your qualification_.

So next time someone in German asks you **"Was bedeutet Erasmus?"**, you will have an answer!

#### Erasmus meaning explained

There is often confusion surrounding the original meaning of the word Erasmus. The term ERASMUS actually is an abbreviation for:

##### _EuRopean Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students_

However it also ties in with the famouse Ductch philospher named Desiderius Erasmus who was a talented activist and thinker in the European Renaissance. This reflects some of the core values of the modern day Erasmus Program. He is also known more formally as Desiderius Erasmus von Rotterdam.

To add further confusion to some prospective students, one of the premier universities in Netherlands is called Erasmus University Rotterdam, sometime. Rest assured, your Erasmus exchange options are not simply limited to this one school!

It is **often mistaken** for the following:

* In addition to the Rotterdam University, there is also Erasmus University Medical Center (called short Erasmus MC).
* Rassie Erasmus - this is actually a well known south african cricket umpire.

Erasmus program *does not* refer to the items listed above.
