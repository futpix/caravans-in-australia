## Silly question, but what is a Caravan?

Welcome to the world of caravans!

We are so excited you are here. But wait a sec - **what on earth is a caravan?**

> The basic characteristics of a caravan is that it's a non motorised vehicle that provides common living needs that can be pulled or towed to a location. It can have power, water and gas, much like a typical home.

The common living needs refer to things like a bed, bathroom or kitchen that are all built in the the caravan.

In Australia, caravans can also be referred to as a "van", because you know, Aussies like to shorten everything for some reason! And not to be confused with an actual Van (the vehicle). Way to complicate everything Australia!

## Where do you take a Caravan?

Caravans are set up at what are generically called Caravan Sites.

Often caravans are used in conjunction with a holiday or road trip. It is used as the primary accomodation for the duration of the vacation. There are speciality caravan sites that are set up to host caravans and provide access to water, electricty and dump points for caravans.

However, there are also plenty of free camp site where people take their caravans too!

The Australian motto when it comes to camping or caravaning is taken very seriously: "Leave no trace".

You should always leave a caravan site exactly how you found it, if not, better. This is part of the group effort to preserve the beauty of the natural Australian environment for wildlife, flora and for future generations to enjoy.

## How Much Are Caravans?

Like all products, the price range can vary significantly depending on what your budget entails and what type of caravan you are wanting.

> To keep your expectations in check early, Caravans are not cheap! Especially when buying new.

**Think about it**. You are basically buying a portable house on wheels. And when you think about the explosion of real estate prices in Australia, then it's surprising that they aren't even pricier.

Don't let that deter you though. You can make a strong ase that a Caravan actually **saves you money**. Plus, there are options for buying an older caravan and renovating it if you are handy enough. This can save you a fortune.

## How Wide Are Caravans

Caravans generally are built to a specification width of between 2 - 2.5 metres. They can vary depending on what brand, type and model you are looking at.

Similar to cars, they need to be constrained to a limited width in order to be safe for use on roads throughout the country. Special licences or permits will likely be needed to tow anything larger than 2.5metres.

But, 2.5 metres in maximum width can fit a surprising ammount of luxery and comfort! We will get to that later.

## How Much Do Caravans Weigh

There is no common weight for a caravan. It will depend on the size, the furnishing and other features such as water tanks.

For example, a smaller 14ft Caravan could be around the 800kg mark, and a 22foot caravan will weigh around 2,000kgs.

It is also important to note that caravans will have a maximum legal weight, which includes the furnishings like fridge and batteries.

> As a simple rule, the longer the caravan, the more it weighs.

The main weights to be familar with are Tare Weights and Aggregate Trailer Mass (ATM).

### TARE Weight

In basic terms, **Tare weight refers to the carvan structure or empty weight before anything is put into it** like people, water, food, belongings, beer... etc.

### ATM Weight

The **ATM** is the weight **set by the manufacturer that denotes the maximum amount of total weight the caravan can hold safely** when it is fully loaded.

## What Are the Best Quality Caravans in Australia

Everybody wants to know how to get the best caravans in Australia. The answer is dependent on several factors.

Will you be taking it off road? Are you a family? Are you doing extended trips or just weekend getways? Do you require lot's of storage?

> Australia is a country with a vast array of terrains, wilderness and isolation.

All these factors must be considered when looking the best quality of caravan to suit your needs.

In the past, the best quality carvan market in Australia was dominated by Millard and Jayco - however, times have changed. These are still great brands, but there are now hundreds of fantastic other quality offerrings on the market to look at.

The best way to find out is to explore our reviews.

## What Caravans Not to Buy

Buying a caravan also involves a certain element of risk. The worry of all purchasers remains "What if we buy a lemon caravan". To our overseas audience, this means a "dud".

Many people get caught up on the aesthetic of the caravan when they are first looking to buy. They see all the nice doors and windows on the outside neatly in tact, then they walk inside and fall in love with the way the kitchen bench or bedside tables look. This is a rookie mistake.

All these shallow furnishing parts are great don't get me wrong, but they shouldn't be the highest priority when evaluating a van to buy. Besides, these types of things can be replaced easily if you need down the track, but other faults can be detrimental to the caravan.

There are many things to look out for when it comes to identifying a caravan that you shouldn't buy.

First things first, if you a buying it new, do not buy it unless it comes with an extended warranty. This is a no brainer.

> It would be staggerring if your manufacturer or dealer did not include a warranty as part of the contract of sale.

The main thing to look for when avoiding a lemon is mainly in the parts you can't see. This means the wiring and the plumbing. Nothing will frustrate you more than leaky plumbing or dodgey electrical work. This is often hard to identify until you have taken your van for a shake down (i.e a short trip where you test it out for a couple of nights).

On top of that, you want the caravan to be structural sound and to have retained it's integrity. Cracks, loose fittings and rattle bits are not a good sign.
