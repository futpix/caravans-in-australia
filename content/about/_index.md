### Let’s create something that solves our own problem...

Writing is our passion. However, a single person's capacity to produce an amount of words per day is limited. It’s restricted based on writing speed, focus of the mind and time available.

*“I wish I could write 10 times as much in a day!”*

**Challenge accepted.**

In 2019, our Content Creation System was born. It allowed one writer to increase from producing 5,000 words per day, to 50,000.

But word count is not the measure of quality of course. The written content needed to be engaging, have a high conversion rate, and allow us the control to convey our own original message.

Cue a year long intense study into “***The Anatomy of a Blog Post.***”

Our research revealed all the subtle strategies used by marketing professionals to capture a reader's attention, and convert them into a return reader, and better yet, a customer.

We applied our findings to our in house app and were stunned by our own results. The [content produced](/product/content-types/) blew our expectations away. And most of it was created in just minutes.

From there we downed all tools on other ventures, and focused all efforts on building an app that could help others benefit.
