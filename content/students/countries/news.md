## Covering automated content creation

The developments involving automated content creation have laid serious imprints on the topic of blog management. How can you make a decision about what's right and wrong regarding this topic? People have different reasons.

The post may be timed for publication from days, weeks, months or even years ahead in a calendar.

Often the articles are timed to go hand in hand with seasonal trends or certain events. Often, the content creation of these posts is outsourced to a digital agency who take full control.

## It reduces the overall cost

First and foremost, look at this.

Automating your content creation is cheaper than doing it all yourself. Many specialist freelance writers and content creation platforms (such as ContentFlame!) are experts in the area. This means they can produce the content faster, and at a lower cost. It's what they do day in, day out.

Bang. You are well on your way to expert levels. Now let's move to the next key aspect.

Search Engine Credibility
Google and other search engines adore fresh content. 

They want websites that are making consistent updates and providing new content for their users. 

What they don't want is a blog sitting dormant for a year without a new post. You will find your blog on page 5000 of the search results if you do that.

Instead, climb your way up the Page Rankings ladder by showing the search engines you are their best friend, and will deliver quality content on a regular basis.

Look at that. You are already more knowledgeable than 5 minutes ago. Let's continue to supercharge your knowledge.

## The Time Saver

Finally, automated content creation saves you time. Many blog owners who are not natural writers find the task of writing an article daunting. As a result, they procrastinate, or spend too much time to produce it. 

Automating your blog content for a price allows that time to be used elsewhere, in an area that you are more specialised in.

And you've tripled what you know.
