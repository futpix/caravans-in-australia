## The bare basics of shark attacks

Welcome to this introduction to the topic of shark attaks and Australian beaches. How do people feel about this subject? An explanation requires us to dissect the topic thoroughly.

When characterising shark attacks we need to mainly consider an injury caused to a human after an encounter with a shark. This differs from merely an encounter where no injury is sustained. Also, the word attack is somewhat misleading. We swim in their environment. They eat fish. We look like seals. Sharks need to feed. They are also defending their home. 

Hold that interpretation of shark attacks close to your chest as we power on.

## The real shark attacks meaning
Keep close to us and you're knowledge of beach safety will explode.

The majority of people out there are misinformed about the relationship involving shark attacks and swimming in the ocean.

You will find it useful to be aware of your own prejudice about sharks prior to going ahead.

May the following information open your mind. Cue the first big announcement.

## 1. Sharks aren't aggressive

Here is the first major consideration.

When attempting to get a safe swimming experience at the beach, beach goers usually experiences fear of sharks. It consumes them like a virus and hinders the ability to reach calmness and rational thought. One way to move past the mental barrier is to remind yourself that sharks are not aggressive, which will improve your chance of swimming without fear.

And like that, you already know more than most people. Now turn your attention onto the following.

## 2. Don't swim alone

Just when you are trying to get into the water, your old friend "shark vision" comes to howls at your brain. Many swimmers have lost hope in the pursuit of swimming without fear of sharks because the mental barrier becomes too great. By doing beach swimming in pairs or groups, it provides a clearer platform to get over your fear.

Bang. Two points down. Two points down, let's get to the next.

## 3. Download the shark saftey apps

Even just thinking about shark attacks casues most swimmers to feel as if they are operating without a leg. Falling further into the hole, you also face the problem of not knowing if sharks are in the water you want to swim in. But swimmers can remove these troubles if they download the shark safety or shark aware apps, creating a pathway to keeping safe in the ocean and taking adequate precautions.

You've now got that initial spark you needed.

## So, shark crisis over?
