Caravans with internal kitchens, also known as recreational vehicles (RVs), are mobile homes on wheels that are equipped with a kitchen area, sleeping quarters, and sometimes additional amenities such as a bathroom, living area, and storage space. They are popular for camping, road trips, and long-term travel. The kitchen area in an RV typically includes a sink, refrigerator, stove, and cabinets for storage.

Camping and cooking have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way for people to get away from the stresses of daily life and connect with nature. The rise of social media has also contributed to the popularity of camping and cooking, as people share pictures and videos of their experiences and inspire others to get outside and try it for themselves.

Many people find cooking while camping to be a fun and rewarding experience, as it allows them to create meals using fresh ingredients and cook them over an open flame.

A caravan oven offers several advantages for campers and travelers who enjoy cooking while on the road:

- Increased cooking options: An oven in a caravan allows for a wider range of cooking options, such as baking, roasting, and grilling, which can be difficult or impossible with a portable stove or barbecue.

- More consistent cooking: An oven provides a more consistent and controlled cooking environment, which can result in better-tasting and more evenly cooked food.

- Space saving: An oven in a caravan can save space by eliminating the need for separate cooking equipment, such as a portable stove or grill, making it a more compact and convenient option.

- Energy efficient: Many caravan ovens are designed to be energy efficient, reducing the amount of electricity or gas needed for cooking and reducing the impact on the environment.

- Safety: Cooking with an oven can be safer than using a portable stove or grill, as the enclosed cooking environment reduces the risk of fire or injury.

Having an oven in a caravan provides campers and travelers with a versatile and convenient cooking option, making it an attractive feature for those who enjoy cooking while on the road.
